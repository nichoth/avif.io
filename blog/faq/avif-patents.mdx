title: Does AVIF have patents?
answer: "As part of its patent pool, Luxembourg-based Sisvel is selling a patent license for AV1 video, the basis for AVIF. This pool of inventions was announced in early 2019, but claims appeared on 10 March 2020. It comprises more than a thousand patents. The claims are subject to challenge. Sisvel has stated that it will not seek royalties for content; however, its license does not exempt software. AOM has not responded to the patent claims. In response to the initial announcement from Sisvel, AOM reiterated its commitment to royalty-free patent licensing and mentioned a patent defense program to help protect AV1 ecosystem participants from unfair patent infringement claims."

AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) is based on the AV1 video codec, which was developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM). In 2019, Luxembourg-based company Sisvel announced that it was offering a patent license for AV1 video as part of its patent pool, which includes over a thousand patents. Sisvel has stated that it will not seek royalties for content, but its license does not exempt software. The AOM has not commented on Sisvel's patent claims, but has reaffirmed its commitment to royalty-free patent licensing and mentioned a patent defense program to protect AV1 ecosystem participants from potential patent infringement claims. It is worth noting that these patent claims are subject to challenge.
