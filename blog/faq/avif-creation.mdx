title: How AVIF was created?
answer: "As a result of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), the AVIF still picture format was developed using the AV1 video format keyframes. Netflix has previously stated that the AVIF image format provides better image quality than JPEG, PNG, and even the newer WebP formats to reduce file size. It is time for a new, more advanced alternative to JPEG, making AVIF an exciting development with great adoption potential."

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec that has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. The development of AVIF was a result of the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), an industry consortium working to develop and promote open media technologies.

AVIF was developed using the AV1 video format keyframes, which allowed it to leverage the advanced video compression technology developed by AOMedia. As a result, AVIF is able to achieve a high level of compression efficiency and provide superior image quality compared to formats like JPEG, PNG, and even WebP.

Netflix has previously reported that AVIF provides better image quality than these other formats while still being able to reduce file size. This makes AVIF an exciting development with great adoption potential, as it offers a more advanced alternative to JPEG, which has been the dominant image format for decades.

Overall, the development of AVIF represents a significant advancement in image compression technology and has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and transmit images.
