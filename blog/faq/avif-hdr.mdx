title: Does AVIF support HDR?
answer: "By enabling uniform brightness, intense colors, and strong contrasts, High-dynamic-range (HDR) technology enhances high-contrast images. AVIF is ideal for HDR. With it, images can be created that go beyond the average 8-bit color depth of standard dynamic range images (SDR). Color depths of 10-bit, 12-bit, and higher can be produced with AVIF. A smooth transition from SDR images to HDR images can be accomplished using AVIF to remap the color depth of an entire image or a portion thereof. Support is offered for PQ and HLG functions, BT.2020 color primaries, and BT.2100 color space."

High-dynamic-range (HDR) technology enhances high-contrast images by enabling uniform brightness, intense colors, and strong contrasts. AVIF is ideal for HDR because it allows users to create images that go beyond the average 8-bit color depth of standard dynamic range images (SDR). Color depths of 10-bit, 12-bit, and higher can be produced with AVIF. AVIF also allows for a smooth transition from SDR images to HDR images by enabling users to remap the color depth of an entire image or a portion thereof. In addition, AVIF supports PQ and HLG functions, BT.2020 color primaries, and the BT.2100 color space. Overall, AVIF provides users with a powerful tool for creating high-quality HDR images.
