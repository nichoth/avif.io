title: Is AVIF based on other formats?
answer: "AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) and the AV1 Video Codec have been developed due to the AOM consortium's efforts. This technology integrates Apple's long-established HEIF container technology with AV1 compression algorithms. With HEIF, image content encoded with AV1 can be exchanged, stored (e.g., metadata), and transmitted consistently and standardized. AVIF and HEIF are analogous in that sense. They use different compression methods to encode image data. HEIF uses the HEVC video format instead of AV1."

AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) is based on the AV1 Video Codec, which was developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOM) consortium. AV1 is a next-generation video codec that was designed to be more efficient than previous codecs such as H.264 and HEVC. To create AVIF, the AOM consortium integrated the AV1 codec with Apple's HEIF container technology, which is a standardized way to store, exchange, and transmit image content.

While AVIF and HEIF are similar in that they both use different compression methods to encode image data, there are some key differences between the two formats. AVIF uses the AV1 codec, which is known for its high compression efficiency and ability to handle high-resolution images. On the other hand, HEIF uses the HEVC codec, which is also known for its high compression efficiency but has some limitations when it comes to handling high-resolution images.

In addition to these technical differences, AVIF and HEIF have different origins and are used for different purposes. AVIF was developed by the AOM consortium as an open-source, royalty-free image format that is suitable for use in open-source projects. HEIF, on the other hand, was developed by Apple and is primarily used in Apple products such as iPhones and iPads.

Overall, AVIF is a next-generation image format that is based on the AV1 codec and is designed to be efficient, high-quality, and open-source. It is suitable for use in a wide range of applications and can be used in conjunction with the HEIF container technology to store, exchange, and transmit image content.
