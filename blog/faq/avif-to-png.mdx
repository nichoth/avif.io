Additionally, some image editing software, such as GIMP or Adobe Photoshop, also support AVIF and can be used to convert AVIF to other formats, including PNG. To do this, simply open the AVIF file in the software and then use the "Save As" or "Export" function to choose the desired output format. It may be necessary to install a plugin or update the software to support AVIF.
