- Film grain
- Alpha channel for transparency
- 4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:4:4 chroma subsampling

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec that has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. As a result, AVIF has a number of features that make it an attractive choice for a variety of use cases.

One of the key features of AVIF is its support for lossless and lossy compression. This means that AVIF can be used for a range of image types, from high-quality photographs to more simple graphics, depending on the needs of the user.

AVIF also supports a number of color space options, including wide color gamut, ISO/IEC CICP, and ICC profiles like Adobe RGB. Additionally, AVIF supports Rec2020 and Rec709 color spaces, making it a versatile choice for a wide range of image types.

AVIF also supports a range of bit depths, including 8, 10, and 12-bit depth. This allows for high dynamic range images, with a wide range of color shades and tones. AVIF also supports monochrome (alpha/depth) or multi-component images, as well as film grain and alpha channels for transparency.

Finally, AVIF supports three types of chroma subsampling: 4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4. This allows for a range of encoding options depending on the needs of the user, from higher quality images with less compression to smaller file sizes with slightly lower image quality.

Overall, AVIF has a range of features that make it a versatile and attractive choice for a wide range of use cases. From its support for lossless and lossy compression, to its wide range of color space and bit depth options, AVIF is well-suited for a variety of image types. Additionally, its support for film grain, alpha channels, and multiple chroma subsampling options make it a powerful and flexible choice for users looking to encode and decode images with a high level of control.
