AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a flexible codec that supports both lossless and lossy modes of operation. This means that you can choose the mode that is best suited for your particular application, depending on your needs.

In lossless mode, AVIF encodes images without any loss of quality or detail. This is useful in situations where it is important to preserve the integrity of the original image, such as when working with high-quality photographs or graphics.

In lossy mode, AVIF encodes images with some loss of quality or detail, in order to achieve a smaller file size. This can be useful in situations where the loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for a smaller file size, such as when working with web images or other types of images that are not as critical to the overall quality of the final product.

Overall, the ability to choose between lossless and lossy modes of operation is one of the key features of AVIF, and it allows you to tailor the codec to your specific needs.
