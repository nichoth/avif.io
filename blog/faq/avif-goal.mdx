AVIF was designed to provide a royalty-free and patent-free solution for web image delivery compared to the existing image formats. The first version of AVIF was released in 2019. Since then, it has offered both a great experience and better quality for viewing images on websites with an efficient compression algorithm.

It has also been designed to be a more advanced alternative to existing formats such as JPEG, with the goal of eventually replacing them as the primary format for web images. AVIF has gained widespread support from leading technology companies and is being developed by the non-profit Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia). Its adoption has the potential to improve the speed and efficiency of the web as a whole, as smaller image files require less data traffic, use less energy, and require less storage.
