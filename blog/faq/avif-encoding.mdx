title: How good is AVIF encoding speed?
answer: "AVIF encodes slowly in general. AOM will continue to improve the codec and reference encoder to improve encoding speed. The AVIF format allows for separately encoding and decoding tiled images since they are sliced into smaller blocks. Encoding blocks in parallel is beneficial because it uses all the CPU cores available."

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec that has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. One aspect of AVIF that is of particular interest is its encoding speed, which is an important factor in the overall performance of image-related tasks.

Overall, AVIF encodes slowly in general compared to other image formats. This can impact the performance of applications that rely on AVIF encoding, particularly when working with large numbers of images. However, it's worth noting that the Alliance for Open Media (AOM), the industry consortium responsible for developing AVIF, is working to improve the codec and reference encoder to improve encoding speed.

One way that AVIF aims to improve encoding speed is by allowing for the separately encoding and decoding of tiled images. Tiled images are sliced into smaller blocks, which can be encoded in parallel, using all the available CPU cores. This can help to improve the efficiency of AVIF encoding, particularly on devices with multi-core processors.

Overall, while AVIF's encoding speed is currently slower than some other image formats, the AVIF team is working to improve this aspect of the codec. By allowing for the separately encoding and decoding of tiled images, AVIF aims to improve encoding speed and make it more efficient.
