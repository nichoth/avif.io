title: Who created AVIF?
answer: "Leading players in the digital economy met in 2015 to discuss file compression. In 2015, companies such as Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Microsoft, Google (including YouTube), Netflix, Intel, AMD, and more formed the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), focusing on internet data usage. In addition to maximizing the performance of individual websites, better file compression can also make the web run faster as smaller files require less data traffic, use less energy, and require less storage. Technology needs to be free of licensing fees and openly accessible to become a standard. With its headquarters in Wakefield, Massachusetts, the Alliance for Open Media is a non-profit association that develops said open, royalty-free technology for multimedia delivery."

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), an industry consortium consisting of leading players in the digital economy. The consortium was formed in 2015 in response to the need for better file compression, with the goal of maximizing the performance of individual websites and making the web run faster by reducing data traffic, energy usage, and storage requirements.

AOMedia is headquartered in Wakefield, Massachusetts and is a non-profit association dedicated to developing open, royalty-free technology for multimedia delivery. The consortium includes companies such as Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Microsoft, Google (including YouTube), Netflix, Intel, AMD, and more.

AVIF was developed as part of AOMedia's efforts to address the need for better file compression, and has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. Its development represents a significant advancement in image compression technology and has the potential to revolutionize the way we store and transmit images.
