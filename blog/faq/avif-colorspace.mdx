title: What color space does AVIF support?
answer: "In addition to standard and nonstandard color spaces, AVIF supports ICC profiles and wide color gamuts and Rec 2020, Pro Photo RGB, and sRGB. Furthermore, it provides Color space signaling using CICP (ITU-T H.273 and ISO/IEC 23091-2) and ICC profiles."

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec that has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. One aspect of AVIF that makes it particularly useful is its support for a wide range of color spaces.

In addition to standard and nonstandard color spaces, AVIF supports ICC profiles and wide color gamuts such as Rec 2020, Pro Photo RGB, and sRGB. This allows AVIF to support a wide range of color representation and can be particularly useful in situations where high color accuracy is important, such as in graphic design or professional photography.

AVIF also provides color space signaling using CICP (ITU-T H.273 and ISO/IEC 23091-2) and ICC profiles. This allows AVIF to accurately represent and reproduce colors, even when the images are displayed on different devices with different color capabilities.

When it comes to choosing the right color space for a specific use case, it's important to consider the intended use of the images, the target audience, and the available processing power. For example, someone creating images for the web may prioritize a smaller file size and choose a standard color space like sRGB, while a graphic designer working on a print project may prioritize color accuracy and choose a wider color space like Pro Photo RGB.

Overall, AVIF's support for a wide range of color spaces and color space signaling is a valuable feature that makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of applications.
