title: Why is AVIF worse than other codecs?
answer: "AVIF has some disadvantages that are worse than other codecs. AVIF supports no progressive rendering. Also, compared to standard image formats, the encoding process takes much longer. Therefore, it may not work with applications that need a large number of files to be encoded quickly (e.g., games or scenes with many animated characters). The longer encoding times may negate the greater savings in file size."

AVIF has some disadvantages that are worse than other codecs. One such disadvantage is the lack of support for progressive rendering. This means that the image is not displayed gradually, but rather all at once after it has fully loaded. This can be an issue for applications that require a fast loading time, such as games or scenes with many animated characters.

Progressive rendering is a technique used in image and video codecs to display a rough preview of an image or video as it is being loaded. This allows the viewer to perceive some structure and detail before the full resolution is available, which can improve the user experience and perceived performance of a website or application. With progressive rendering, the image or video is displayed in a series of increasingly detailed scans, starting with a low resolution version and gradually increasing in resolution as more data is loaded. This can be especially useful for large images or videos that take a long time to load, as it allows the viewer to start viewing the content while it is still loading, rather than having to wait for the entire file to be downloaded before anything is displayed.

Another disadvantage of AVIF is the longer encoding process compared to standard image formats. This may not be suitable for applications that require a large number of files to be encoded quickly. The longer encoding times may negate the benefits of the smaller file sizes achieved with AVIF.

Additionally, AVIF may not be well-suited for applications that need to support a wide range of devices or platforms, as not all hardware and software may have native support for AVIF. In such cases, it may be necessary to use a transcoding or conversion process to support AVIF, which can introduce additional overhead and latency. Finally, AVIF may not always produce the best results in terms of image quality or file size compared to other codecs, depending on the specific characteristics and requirements of the images being encoded. In these cases, it may be necessary to carefully evaluate the trade-offs and choose the codec that best meets the needs of the application.
