title: Does AVIF support tiling?
answer: "AVIF supports tiling, which speeds up multicore CPU encoding. After color transforming, the image is divided into tiles, and rectangular areas are separately transformed and encoded. There is no limit to the size of a tile, and the entire image can be considered one tile."

Tiling in AVIF allows for the encoding of images to be done in parallel, using multiple CPU cores. This can significantly improve the speed of encoding, especially for large images. Tiling works by dividing the image into smaller rectangular areas, or tiles, which are then transformed and encoded independently. The size of the tiles can be varied depending on the needs of the application, and it is even possible to consider the entire image as a single tile. Tiling is an important feature of AVIF that helps to make it a more efficient and performant image format.
