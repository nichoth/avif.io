title: How good is AVIF decoding speed?
answer: "AVIF decodes well and is likely to improve in speed. Various performance improvements have been achieved in recent releases of decoders. Hardware support for AV1 is starting to appear. Still, we are confident that dedicated hardware is more likely to be catered to video decoding than images."

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a modern image codec that has gained widespread adoption due to its high compression rate and support from a wide range of applications. One aspect of AVIF that is of particular interest is its decoding speed, which is an important factor in the overall performance of image-related tasks.

Overall, AVIF decodes well and is likely to improve in speed as new decoders are released. In recent releases, various performance improvements have been achieved, which have helped to make AVIF decoding faster and more efficient.

Hardware support for AV1, the video codec on which AVIF is based, is also starting to appear. This can help to further improve the decoding speed of AVIF and make it more efficient. However, it's worth noting that dedicated hardware is more likely to be focused on video decoding rather than image decoding, so the extent to which hardware support will improve AVIF decoding speed remains to be seen.

Overall, AVIF's decoding speed is a strong point that makes it a valuable choice for a wide range of applications. As new decoders and hardware support become available, we can expect AVIF's decoding speed to continue to improve.
