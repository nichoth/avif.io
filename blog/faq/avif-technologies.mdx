AVIF, the AV1 Image File Format, is a technology stack that combines several different technologies to enable advanced image processing functions and the mapping of AV1 keyframes. The technology stack includes the ISO BMFF Byte Stream Format, which is a standard for multimedia file formats that defines how a file should be formatted and structured. It also includes IFF/HEIF, a file format for storing digital images, and MIAF, a file format used for storing image sequences and individual images. All of these technologies work together to enable the creation and manipulation of AV1 image files, which are known for their high-quality image compression and the ability to support high dynamic range (HDR) images. AVIF is an open-source technology, which means that it is freely available for anyone to use and modify. It is also royalty-free, making it an attractive option for developers and organizations looking to incorporate advanced image processing capabilities into their projects.
