## What is AVIF

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is a new image format that uses the AV1 video codec to compress images. AV1 is an open, royalty-free video codec that was developed by the Alliance for Open Media, a consortium of technology and media companies. It is designed to be more efficient than previous video codecs, such as H.265 (HEVC) and VP9, and is intended to be a successor to the widely used H.264 codec.

AVIF is a file format for storing still images and image sequences that use AV1 for compression. It was developed by the AV1 Image File Format (AVIF) Working Group, which is part of the AV1 project. AVIF offers better compression than traditional image formats like JPEG and PNG, while maintaining the same or better visual quality.

Currently, support for AVIF is limited, but it is expected to become more widely supported in the future as the AV1 codec becomes more widely adopted. Some web browsers, such as Google Chrome, already support AVIF, and support is expected to expand to other browsers and applications over time.

If you are using a tool or platform that does not currently support AVIF, you may be able to use a converter to convert AVIF images to a more widely supported format like JPEG or PNG.

## What is Notion

Notion is a software tool for managing projects and taking notes. It is a piece of software that helps members of a company or organization coordinate deadlines, objectives, and tasks to increase efficiency and productivity.
