## What is AVIF

An AVIF file is a compressed image stored in the HEIF format and represents a still image compressed with AV1. The AV1 video coding format represents the next step in media compression, according to most tech experts.

As a contemporary image format, AVIF offers high compression rates with a wide range of features. It is possible to compress data either losslessly or lossily. Alpha channels, as well as other graphic formats, store additional information concerning transparent image areas. Transparency data is used to release objects, such as user interfaces, collages, and company logos.

Furthermore, AVIF includes extended color spaces (Wide Color Gamut, WCG) and additional graininess, color undersampling, and HDR (High Dynamic Range). HDR is a technology that enables uniform brightness and solid colors and contrasts in images. HDR can be easily achieved with AVIF since it can go beyond the usual 8-bit color depth of standard dynamic range (SDR) images (up to 12-bit and higher color depths are possible). The metadata can be used to share HDR information and information concerning the color gamut. Animation sequences - similar to GIF animations (Animated GIFs) - are also possible (support for multi-layer images in image elements and sequences).

## What is Pixboost

Pixboost is a cloud Image CDN service designed to reduce the file size of raster images (such as JPG, PNG, etc.) and decrease loading times. The file of an optimized image is cached on the Content Delivery Network (CDN) of Google, which increases the speed at which images can be retrieved in the future. As well as resizing and cropping photos, the service also makes it simple to produce responsive images, which respect the screen size of the device on which they will be displayed. The URL of the image must be modified to utilize the service. You can find the source code of Pixboost's image manipulation service on GitHub.

## Pixboost supports AVIF

Pixboost was among the first image CDNs to introduce AVIF. The API does not require you to manually select the target format for an image, but rather, determines the best format for a particular image on a case-by-case basis. Consequently, if a client (web browser) supports AVIF, then an AVIF will generally be served. Pixboost determines the supported formats based on the Accept HTTP header.

Assume that you have an image on your website, AVIF and Pixboost can be used together by wrapping the URL as follows:

<Syntax language="html">{`<img
src="image.jpg?optimise?auth=api-key"
alt="test image"
/>`}</Syntax>

### Docker

Pixboost also offers their service to be used though an own infrastructure using a <Link href="github.com/Pixboost/transformimgs" text="docker image"/>.

## Features of Pixboost

Pixboost is an image optimization and compression tool that helps businesses reduce their image file sizes quickly and easily. It offers a range of features, including lossless compression, automatic resizing, cropping, and other adjustments to optimize images for the web. With its unique Smart Compression technology, it can identify how much data can be removed from an image without compromising its quality or visual impact. Pixboost also features options like automated CSS generation to ensure all the code is properly optimized for faster loading times on websites. Furthermore, it supports multiple file formats such as JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIFs, SVG and more so business owners don’t need to worry about converting their images before using the service. Finally, thanks to its user-friendly dashboard interface users can easily manage their settings in one convenient place,

## Benefits of Using Pixboost

Using Pixboost comes with a variety of benefits that make it an appealing option for many businesses and professionals. First off, it is easy to use and has a user-friendly interface. It also supports multiple formats so you can easily upload your images in whatever format you prefer without worrying about compatibility issues. Furthermore, Pixboost offers powerful compression algorithms that not only reduce the size of your images but also retain their quality and sharpness so they look great even on high-resolution screens. Moreover, using the service reduces loading times of websites significantly which is beneficial for any business’s SEO efforts as faster loading pages are preferred by search engines. Finally, its pricing model is reasonable and flexible with plans starting from free to more advanced paid subscriptions depending on your needs which makes it suitable for any budget,

## How to Set Up and Use Pixboost

Using Pixboost is a straightforward process that requires only a few steps. Firstly, sign up for an account on their website and create an API key. Once the API key is generated, you can begin setting up the service by specifying parameters such as image source (URL or cloud storage), output format, optimization level, etc. After these settings are configured, you can then embed the API key into your website code so that images processed through Pixboost are uploaded directly onto your site without manual intervention. To ensure optimal performance of the service, it is recommended to configure caching options so that pre-processed images are served quickly when requested. Finally, you can monitor all activity in real-time using their dashboard page which shows detailed information about each image request as well as potential errors encountered during processing,

## Best Practices for Optimizing Images with Pixboost

Optimizing images with Pixboost can be a great way to improve the quality of your website's visuals and cut down on page loading times. Pixboost is an easy to use, AI-powered image optimization service that automatically resizes, compresses, and optimizes images for better performance. To get the best results from your image optimization efforts, here are some best practices to keep in mind when using Pixboost:

1. Use high-quality source images in JPG or PNG formats wherever possible. Pixelated or low-resolution source images won’t produce desirable results when optimized with Pixboost.
2. Aim to upload photos that are no larger than 3MB in size before optimization - this will ensure fast loading speeds without overly compromising image quality.
3. Take advantage of the auto format option provided by Pixboost if you want consistent results across multiple devices and platforms - it is especially useful if you have a responsive website design that needs to display different versions of the same image on different devices and browsers.
4. If you need more control over how your images look after being optimized by Pixboost, consider enabling manual adjustments such as cropping or resizing so that you can fine tune their appearance for specific applications and requirements.
5. Test out different settings for compression levels as well as resolution parameters until you find the perfect balance between file size reduction and image quality preservation for each of your uploaded files – this will help ensure maximum efficiency throughout your project lifecycle while maintaining good visual results at all times,
