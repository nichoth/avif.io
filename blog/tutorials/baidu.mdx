## What is AVIF

AV1 Image File Format is an image file format specification that uses HEIF containers to store images or sequences compressed with AV1. Compared to HEIC, it uses HEVC compression and the same container format based on ISOBMFF. A version of AVIF was released in February 2019. The Netflix 2020 tests showed that AVIF was more efficient in compressing raw images, text, and graphics, had better detail preservation, fewer blocking artifacts, and minor color bleeding around hard edges. Major players in the digital economy support AVIF's continued expansion. They are both open-source formats. This technology does not incur any additional costsâ€”open-source benefits to the big players and the entire community.

AVIF is free of charge, one of the most important advantages it has over HEIF, which is Apple's preferred format. AVIF offers a high level of image quality and a wide range of functionality, matching the requirements of a modern image format. A recent study found that AVIF reduced the image size by 50 percent compared to JPEG. Its competitor, WebP, has been unable to establish itself, so AVIF is more efficient. Video-on-demand, cloud, and webspace providers benefit from AVIF compression to reduce video-load times, conserve network bandwidth, and reduce data streams. It has many other uses as well. Photographers, printers, etc., can all benefit from it. It can also benefit from the format's development by receiving higher-resolution pictures, thus reducing resource usage.

## What is Baidu

Baidu Browser is a web browser developed by Chinese search giant Baidu. It was available for both desktop and mobile devices, and included features such as ad blocking, torrenting, and video downloading. However, the browser was deprecated in April 2019.

Baidu Browser has faced criticism for its handling of user data and security. The browser was found to leak search terms, hard drive serial number, network MAC address, and the title of all visited webpages to third parties. It has also been criticized for its proxy request feature, which enables access to some usually blocked websites in China.

Since Baidu Browser's discontinuation, users have turned to alternative web browsers for their browsing needs. Some popular options include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. These browsers offer a range of features and prioritize user privacy and security.

While Baidu Browser may have had its own set of features and capabilities, its questionable handling of user data and security concerns make it a less appealing option for many users. Alternative web browsers offer a safer and more reliable browsing experience.

## AVIF support

Since Baidu's latest update is older than the image format, Baidu does not support AVIF.
