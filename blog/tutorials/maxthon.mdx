## What is AVIF

In HEIF containers, AV1 Image File Format specifies the format for storing images and image sequences compressed with AV1. Comparable to HEIC, HEIC uses ISOBMFF for the container format but HEVC for compression. Version 1.0.0 of the AVIF specification was released in February. The Netflix 2020 test showed that AVIF has a higher compression efficiency than JPEG, retains more detail, has fewer blocking artifacts, and has little color bleeding around hard edges in composites of natural images, text, and graphics. AVIF is a format supported by big players in the digital economy that are driving its expansion. This is because both formats are open source. There are no additional charges associated with AOMedia technology. All open source developers benefit from this, not just the big players. The AVIF format is free of charge is a significant advantage over HEIF, which is still the preferred format for Apple. With AVIF, you can combine high image quality and many functions in one format. A current study shows that AVIF reduces an image's size by 50% compared to JPEG. In addition, AVIF is more efficient than WebP, which has not established itself. The highly efficient AVIF compression reduces website load times, conserves network bandwidth, and reduces data streams for video-on-demand providers, cloud hosts, and webspace providers. AVIF offers several benefits that extend beyond its online use. Photo archives, photographers, printers, etc. Those who use the format can also receive higher-quality images, which will ease the burden on limited resources.

## Pros and Cons of Maxthon Web Browser

Maxthon web browser is a popular, feature-rich web browser for Windows and Mac OSX. It has many advanced features such as tabbed browsing, an intuitive user interface, quick page loading times, support for plug-ins and extensions, synchronization across multiple devices and the ability to switch between different search engines with ease. However, there are also some potential drawbacks to using it that should be taken into consideration before making the decision to install it on your computer. On the plus side of things, Maxthon offers a great degree of customization options to let users personalize their experience according to their own needs. Furthermore, its privacy settings allow users to set how much information they want stored on the local machine or remotely. Another pro is its performance – due to its optimized engine and efficient memory management techniques, pages load quickly even with multiple tabs open at once. Finally, Maxthon’s support team is always available if there are any issues that need addressing. On the downside of things however, some may find the installation process cumbersome due to the amount of ads that are included in the package which can slow down users’ computers significantly if not removed properly after installation. Additionally, while certain features such as cross-device synchronization work well in theory but may not always be reliable in practice – particularly when connecting devices from different manufacturers. Finally, while Maxthon has been known for being highly secure against online threats such as viruses and malware; recently based on reports from independent security firms have shown that it may not be as effective against phishing attacks compared to other browsers in this regard which could potentially put user’s data at risk.
